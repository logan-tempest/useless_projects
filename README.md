### Project Description
A shy and uncertain AI astrologer that generates horoscopes based on your name, gender, and date of birth. It also provides sassy, roasting follow-up answers in Manglish (Malayalam-English).

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Typical horoscopes are too confident and boring. They lack the delightful uncertainty and passive-aggressive charm of a shy astrologer who might just predict your doom.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
A funny chatbot that provides vague, mystical, and sometimes dark horoscopes, and then roasts you if you dare to question its fuzzy predictions.
